Here is a list of things for the drive train and charging
we should consider to buy.

WHEELS:
=======

What do you think of these. I am willing to buy them now ..

all are  $130-$150 (incl shipping), I think the Jazzy is more standard.

I presume one can control the speed through some mechanism.

Building a base for the above shouldn't be to difficult .. some wood, a stick saw, some screws and a single swizzle front wheel.
Some consideration must be given how the motors will be positions, some of the above seem straight drive, others 90 degrees.

Batteries:
==========

(don;t know how to compute the size we need ) .. I see 35Ah  , 15Ah,  12Ah, 5Ah  ( they come in a pack as 2 since we need 24 V )

CHARGER:
========

All of these seem to be working of a 24V / 200W system (not clear whether that is per wheel or as a pair)

 or on the cheap.

Can we charge batteries in series ?  ( sorry my EE knowledge is basically 0.01 on a scale from 0 - 10 )

24V -> 5V reducer to hook up the PI.
