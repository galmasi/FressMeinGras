This project is an attempt to build an autonomous lawn mower from scratch.
Hence the project name "Fress Mein Gras" which is german for "eat my grass".

The project will go through a few steps:

a) first we will investigate whether GPS can be used to accurately 
   track the position of a rover within approximately 1 foot.
   We are considering a technology called RTKLIB for this, that relies
   on a fixed reference GPS base and the rover GPS base to eliminate
   GPS errors.
   If no possible, then other sensor technologies will be identified.
   One goal is to NOT lay down a guide line.

b) will require to build a rover base and interface with the GPS
   guided control system.
   Thoughts here are using motors typically used in wheel chairs.

c) build a charging station as the rover will likely not be able 
   to run for long times.
